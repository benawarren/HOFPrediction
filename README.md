# HOFPrediction
I used Python to write a program that predicts whether or not baseball players will make the Hall of Fame based on their career statistics.

# This repo contains:

* A colab notebook containing the Python code for the program
* An html file I created in R Markdown that shows how I pre-processed the data
* The input file for the colab notebook
